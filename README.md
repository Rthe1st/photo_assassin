# Photo Assassin
A pervasive (i.e. walk around and do stuff) game inspired by [Schniper](http://ludocity.org/wiki/Schniper)

I'm sure this variant must exist somehwere already.

The game is played over a decent sized space with players attempting to "snipe" each other by taking photos.

## Requirements
* 2+ people
* An area with lots of cover. Could be a  park, indoor space like a museum or a set of streets.
* Each person needs a phone and the ability to send photos to a group chat. I'm planning to use whatsapp

## Play
* Have all players meet at a starting point
* Created a group chat with all the players in it
* Post where players are allowed to go (i.e. "Don't leave the park")
* Post the initial list of each players target. Each player must have 1 target and the list should loop through all players.

So by repeatdly following each targets target, you go through every player and get back to the initial target.

* Post the time limit for the game.
* Let the players disperse. Targets can't be sniped for X minutes.
* Players now snipe each other, posting their snipe photos to the group chat.
* Game ends when a player has sniped everyone or the time limit is up

## Sniping Rules
* To "snipe" their target, players must take a photo of them and post it to the group chat immediately.
* You can only snipe your current target
* Photos of 
* Their next target is the current target of their victim.

The target keeps playing as normal
* The winner is person that first person to snipe everyone, or the person who snipes the most people in the time limit.
* Players mustn't leave the play zone (park, building, etc)
* Everyone one starts at the same place. Players have X minutes to disperse before sniping is allowed.

## Clarifications
* Photos should be posted as soon as they are taken, because this helps give away their position.
Hard to enforce though.
* Players can talk to each other, work together, snitch on each others positions, etc.

i.e. If you see the person targeting you, might be useful to post their location in the chat to distract them
* Because the target list and snipe photos are public player know who is targeting who at all times

## Other notes
* Telegram might be better cause they we can have a room bot,  i.e. to answer questions, show rules/target list etc
