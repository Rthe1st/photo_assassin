# Photo Assassin
A pervasive (i.e. walk around and do stuff) game inspired by [Schniper](http://ludocity.org/wiki/Schniper)

I'm sure this variant must exist somehwere already.

The game is played over a decent sized space with players attempting to "snipe" each other by taking photos.

## Requirements
* 2+ people
* An area with lots of cover. Could be a  park, indoor space like a museum or a set of streets.
* Each person needs a phone and the ability to send photos to a group chat. I'm planning to use whatsapp

## Play
* Have all players meet at a starting point
* Created a group chat with all the players in it
* Post where players are allowed to go (i.e. "Don't leave the park")
* Post the initial list of each player's targets. Each player must have 1 target and the list should loop through all players.

So by repeatedly following each target's target, you go through every player and get back to the initial target.

* Post the time limit for the game.
* Let the players disperse. Targets can't be sniped for the first X minutes.
* Players now snipe each other, posting their snipe photos to the group chat.
* Game ends when a player has sniped everyone or the time limit is up

Player with the most snipes wins

## Sniping Rules
* To "snipe" their target, players must take a photo of them and post it to the group chat immediately.
* You can only snipe your current target
* Their new target is the sniped person's initial target.

The target keeps playing as normal
* You can also snipe the person targeting you, giving you immunity for X minutes.

As normal, the photo must be posted to the group chat (also giving away their postion)

This is to encourage the sniper to be stealthy

## Clarifications
* Photos must be posted as soon as they are taken

This means sniping someone gives away your current position to the whole group
* Players communiicating/working together is encouraged

i.e. If you see the person targeting you, might be useful to post their location in the chat to distract them
* Because the target list and snipe photos are public, players know who is targeting who at all times

## Other notes
* Telegram might be better cause they we can have a room bot,  i.e. to answer questions, show rules/target list etc
* If a player snipes everyone, you could have them loopback to their initial target. The game would only end when the time limit is up
* Bit worried the game might be too isolating as is, how can more ad-hoc teamwork be encouraged?
* "objectives" could be used to make the game easier/faster

Perhaps game-master could send out ad-hoc tasks to be completed ("take photo at X place), which would create risky spots
